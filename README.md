#Meng Lin's Playground

Over the years, I've used different types of blogging website or engine, and always tried to keep myself up-to-date. Even though losing readership is always a problem, I chose to do this because I was too lazy to even get a domain and host it myself. 

As part of my 2015 resolution, I'll spend more time documenting stuff I learned (up-to-date or not, technical or not, useful or not). And of course I will resort to finally setup my own host.
